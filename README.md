## Features

-  Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`
-  Real-time input and result display
-  Operation history panel
-  Clear (`C`) and **Clear History** buttons

---

## Development Process

1. **UI Layout & Interaction Setup**
   - Structured layout using `BoxWithConstraints` and `Offset`
   - Positioned calculator buttons with composables

2. **Business Logic Integration**
   - String and integer state handling
   - Arithmetic operations and user input parsing

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Integrated **Material 3** components for modern design
   - Added visual feedback via borders, spacing, and typography

4. **Extra Features**
   - Display of recent calculations in a scrollable history section
   - Dedicated buttons to reset calculator and clear history

## Challenges Faced

- Learning to manipulate layout components such as `Box`, `Column`, and `Row`
- Managing state consistently during operations and input sequences
- Ensuring accurate offset and alignment across various screen sizes

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** – main programming language
- **Jetpack Compose** – declarative UI toolkit
- **Material 3** – modern Android design system
- **Android Studio** – IDE for development and testing
